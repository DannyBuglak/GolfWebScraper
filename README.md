## Golf Equipment Web Scraper 

# Explanation

This is a short web scraper I wrote that scrapes [Carl's Golfland Website](https://www.carlsgolfland.com/) for quick and easy checking of prices and available clubs.

# Note:
If an entry says "No Price" for the price, this means that the price is not directly available on the front page. The link may need to be clicked, or the club has to be added to the cart on the actual website.
